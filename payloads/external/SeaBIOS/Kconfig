	  Select this option if you have a specific commit or branch

	  Set this field to the IO address of a serial port for SeaBIOS' VGA

	int
	help
		Some PS/2 keyboard controllers don't respond to commands immediately
		after powering on. This specifies how long SeaBIOS will wait for the
		keyboard controller to become ready before giving up.

config SEABIOS_THREAD_OPTIONROMS
	prompt "Hardware init during option ROM execution"
	default n
	bool
	help
		Allow hardware init to run in parallel with optionrom execution.

		This can reduce boot time, but can cause some timing
		variations during option ROM code execution. It is not
		known if all option ROMs will behave properly with this option.

config SEABIOS_MALLOC_UPPERMEMORY
	bool
	default y
	help
		Use the "Upper Memory Block" area (0xc0000-0xf0000) for internal
		"low memory" allocations.  If this is not selected, the memory is
		instead allocated from the "9-segment" (0x90000-0xa0000).
		This is not typically needed, but may be required on some platforms
		to allow USB and SATA buffers to be written correctly by the
		hardware.  In general, if this is desired, the option will be
		set to 'N' by the chipset Kconfig.
